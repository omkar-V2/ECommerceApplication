# Welcome to the Cross Country Coding Test

This coding test is structured into four distinct projects designed to evaluate your ability to organize code and architect software solutions effectively. Below is the detailed breakdown of the project structure:

## Project Structure
- **ECommerceApplication.API**: The Presentation Layer.
  - This is a standard ASP.NET API project. Define your endpoints and controllers here.
- **ECommerceApplication.Models**: The Models Layer.
  - Use this standard class library project to add all the models required for the application.
- **ECommerceApplication.Services**: The Service Layer.
  - This standard class library should contain all your business logic.
- **ECommerceApplication.Data**: The Data Layer.
  - This project is equipped with mock data and handles data access operations.
- **ECommerceApplication.Tests**: The Testing Layer.
  - Contains unit tests for each question to validate the solutions against the specified requirements. Ensure your code passes these tests to confirm functionality.

## Guidelines
- **Code Organization**:
  - Ensure to add your code to the appropriate projects. This helps maintain a clear separation of concerns. Treat this test as if it were a real-world project by demonstrating your ability to structure code cleanly and logically.
- **Efficiency and Simplicity**:
  - Aim for clarity and efficiency in your coding. Avoid overengineering your solutions; focus on creating concise and effective implementations. If you think you would have done something differently given more time, make sure you mention it during the code review time.
- **Resource Use**:
  - You are allowed to use search engines during this coding test to help solve problems or reference necessary documentation.
- **LINQ**:
  - You are encouraged to use LINQ whenever it applies.
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Each question is accompanied by a unit test designed to validate whether the implemented solution meets the required output. Ensure your solutions pass these tests to confirm they fulfill the criteria specified in each question.

**Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your innovative solutions!**
